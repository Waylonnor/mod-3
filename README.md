**Token Contract README**

**Overview:**

This Solidity smart contract implements a basic ERC20 token named "Token" with the symbol "TK". It includes functionalities for minting, burning, and transferring tokens. The contract is written in accordance with the OpenZeppelin library and follows the ERC20 standard.

**Contract Features:**

1. **Token Name:** "Token"
2. **Token Symbol:** "TK"
3. **Token Supply:** Upon deployment, the contract creator is assigned 500 tokens.
4. **Ownership:** The contract implements an ownership mechanism where the deployer becomes the initial owner. Only the owner has the authority to mint new tokens.
5. **Functionality:** The contract provides the following functionalities:

    a. **Mint Tokens:** The owner can mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
    
    b. **Burn Tokens:** Any token holder can burn a specific amount of their tokens, reducing the total token supply.
    
    c. **Transfer Tokens:** Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses, provided they have a sufficient balance.

6. **Access Control:** The contract implements a modifier named `onlyOwner` to restrict access to certain functions exclusively to the contract owner.

**Usage:**

1. **Deployment:** Deploy the contract to a compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) using a Solidity compiler, preferably version 0.8.17 or higher.

2. **Interacting with the Contract:**

    a. To mint tokens, call the `mintTokens` function with the desired recipient address and the amount of tokens to be minted.
    
    b. To burn tokens, call the `burnTokens` function with the amount of tokens to be burned.
    
    c. To transfer tokens, call the `transferTokens` function with the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to be transferred.

3. **Ownership Transfer:** Ownership transfer functionality is not explicitly implemented in this contract. However, it can be added by extending the contract to include a function allowing the current owner to transfer ownership to another address.
